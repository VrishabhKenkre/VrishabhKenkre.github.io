### 👋 About Me

---

I’m a **🛠️ Hardware and Mechatronics Engineer** who loves building things that **move**, **sense**, and **respond** to the world. Currently pursuing my master's at **🎓 Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)**, I spend my time exploring how machines can act smartly in complex environments.

From robots that **test wall outlets** to systems that **sense, decide, and move with real-time embedded control,** I enjoy working on projects that mix creativity with hands-on building. Whether it’s **designing**, **wiring**, or **debugging**, I’m all about turning ideas into real, working machines.

When I’m not building, you’ll probably find me **🔧 tinkering with parts**, sketching ideas, or taking something apart just to see *how-it-reallllly-works* 🤓.
