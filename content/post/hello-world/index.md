### ðŸ”§ About Me


---

I'm a **Hardware and Mechatronics Engineer** passionate about building robots that think, move, and interact with the real world. Currently pursuing my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering (Robotics & Control Systems) at **Carnegie Mellon University**, I design embedded systems and control algorithms that bring electromechanical systems to life.

From balancing a ball using air pressure to developing autonomous robots with **Jetson Orin Nano, Teensy 4.1, and Raspberry Pi 4 and STM32-F401RE**, Iâ€™ve consistently worked across the full stack: **mechanical design, electronics, embedded firmware, and real-time control**. Iâ€™ve built 4WD STM32 platforms from scratch, designed wall-interacting robots, and modeled complex hybrid dynamics for manipulators.

My industry experience includes **precision mold manufacturing, aircraft systems analysis**, and **data-driven fraud detection**â€”giving me a unique edge in both hardware execution and systems thinking.

When Iâ€™m not debugging a circuit or writing control code, youâ€™ll find me **tinkering with sensors**, experimenting with **fabrication techniques**, or prototyping something from scratch just to figure out *how-it-reallllly-works*.
